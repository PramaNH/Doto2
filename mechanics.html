        To play the game, you can right click on any screen to move your characters and you can right click on the map too (map will be discussed later). 
        <br>
        <br>
        To attack the enemy's character you can right-click them, and to use a skill, you can click your character's skill image or use hotkeys (Q, W, E, R on default). 
        <br>
        To combine attack with skill (skill attack) is pressing a skill first then aim at the enemy using right-click.
        <br>
        <br>
        To win, you need a strategy. The strategy is important to gain an advantage for your team, you need to be reminded too that the enemy has their own strategy. So to win, you need a better strategy than them.
